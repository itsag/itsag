Hi, I am Ajay.

I am a front-end developer presently working at [@bushel](https://github.com/bushel). I make applications for the web, mobile and server-side platforms. I write code, develop user interfaces and do pretty much anything if it intrigues me. 

I specialise in building web and mobile apps using React and React Native. I am also pretty experienced working with Angular.js, Node.js, Express and Sails and familiar with Relational and NoSQL databases. I use Firebase to host most of my projects because of its ease of use and a good user interface. 

I love to admire, design and create beautiful user interfaces. That is why, I make sure that the things I make look pleasing and work flawlessly. You'll always find me listening to music while I am on and off work. I truly believe that music drives me and brings creativity in me. [Find me on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/z0hftscph9dnwvvbz1pynz4ng?si=Tv8DjeA-QoKRo8W9Y1NVtQ)

I am active on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8349557/ajay) at regular intervals. 
Have any questions about React, React Native or anything in general? [Would be happy to answer them](https://github.com/itsag/itsag/discussions/new).

P.S. I would love to be a part of and contribute to any open source projects. So if you have one, invite me. ðŸ˜‰
