Hi, I am Ajay.

I am a front-end developer presently working at [@bushel](https://github.com/bushel). I make applications for the web, mobile and server-side platforms. I write code, develop user interfaces and do pretty much anything if it intrigues me. 

I specialize in building web and mobile apps using React and React Native. I am also pretty experienced working with Angular.js, Node.js, Express or Sails and familiar with MySQL and MongoDB. I use Firebase to host most of my projects because of its ease of use and a good user interface.

I like admiring, designing and building user interfaces.
